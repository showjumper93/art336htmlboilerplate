                    <p>When Eric Lamaze started show jumping three decades ago, he would often go to racetrack paddocks in his native Quebec and scout broken-down thoroughbreds that might have potential in the jumping ring. </p>

                    <p>Today, horses no longer amble off the track for a second career in jumping. At the four-day Geneva International Horse Show, which starts on Thursday, top riders like Lamaze, the 2008 Olympic individual champion, will mount fine-tuned animals that have been specifically bred for the discipline. </p>

                    <p>These elite horses are typically warmbloods, often breeds like Dutch and Belgian Warmbloods or Selle Français. Trained to jump from a young age, they receive perks on par with other globe-trotting professional athletes — air travel, special diets and a team of handlers — and routinely command handsome purchase prices. A 10-year-old Selle Français gelding, Palloubet d’Halong, was purchased this year for a record-setting 11 million euros, or about $15 million, by Jan Tops, a former show jumper and founder of the Longines Champions Tour. </p>

                    <p>The quality of the animal is so much different now,” said Lamaze, 45. “Years ago, you basically just wanted to see if a horse could jump, and if he could jump, you gave it your best shot.</p>

                    <p>The evolution of the equine athlete mirrors changes in the jumping ring. Gone are the heavy metal rails and solid brick walls. Since the 1970s, obstacles have become progressively lighter, taller and more fragile. Even the slightest brush of a hoof on a plank will now send it tumbling. </p>


                    <p>Horses must be agile, strong and “very, very careful,” said Ben Maher, a Briton who is one of the sport’s top riders, because typically only clear rounds — those with no obstacles down — win classes.</p>

                    <p>“The margin for error is so small now, you have one rail down and it’s over nine times out of 10,” he said. “So the horses have had to be changed to accommodate the courses that are built.” </p>

                    <p>An increase in the number of jumping events and in prize money (Geneva’s marquee class, the Rolex Grand Prix, has a purse of €500,000) and the spread of the sport across the world have encouraged the breeding of jumping-only horses — and stimulated the marketplace. Tops’s purchase is just the latest expensive exchange. Before the 2012 Olympics, the Saudi Equestrian Fund bought Dunstan Delphi, a nine-year-old mare, from the New Zealand rider Katie McVean for an undisclosed sum that was reported to be higher than €7 million. </p>
